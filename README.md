These are some AI programs :

main.py : This is a perceptron that can predict the color of a flower with only her width and height. At the top of the program, I created two arrays to store some flowers data ( one containing the color of a flower and the other containing the size ) in order to feed the perceptron.

detect.py : This is a program that uses cv2 and can detect your face. ( Requirements : Camera )
